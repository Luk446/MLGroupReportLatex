\section{Data Analysis and Exploration}

Based on the literature discussed previously, the data used in the following scenarios has undergone careful analysis in order to understand and prepare for upcoming ML.

The MRI classifying dataset was sourced from a comprehensive collection of MRI images collected from a series of hospitals in Bangladesh \cite{rahman_2024}. The data holds great value and significant effort was made to collect and label high quality images. A sample of the three classes of data present is shown in fig.~\ref{fig:three_side_by_side}, pictures (a to b).  The proprietor has already uniformly resized to an equal length and height.
