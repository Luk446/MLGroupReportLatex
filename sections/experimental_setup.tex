\section{Experimental setup}

As the content of the datasets varies in format and shape, the experimental setup for each varies too.

\subsection{Baseline Training and Evaluation Experiments}

For the stroke dataset, after the data was cleaned, three primary machine learning models were used.

\subsection{Stroke analysis}

The selected models were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
    \item Logistic Regression
    \item Random Forest Classifier
\end{itemize}

The data was split into two parts for training and testing, 70\% was used for training the models and the remaining 30\% was set aside to test how well they performed. The performance of the models were evaluated using four main measurements; accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. After applying SMOTE, the models were retrained.

\subsection{Neural Networks}

To ensure a balanced evaluation of the stroke data and to compare with the classical models, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) was used to train the balanced data.
