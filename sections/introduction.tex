In this report, a selection of differing machine learning (ML) techniques are explored. Each technique was chosen based on its area of application. The subject area of medicine was chosen for exploration, and a selection of datasets are explored with different features and formats: (i) a collection of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images that exhibit three cancer-based pathologies; (ii) a tabular dataset containing patient demographic and healthcare-related information; (iii) ?.

To approach the ML problems, an understanding of previous literature on the topic is required for an effective workflow. Academic papers were reviewed to gain an effective skill set and background knowledge required to begin experimentation.
