In this report, a selection of differing machine learning (ML) techniques are explored. Each technique was chosen based on its area of application. The subject area of medicine was chosen for exploration, and a selection of datasets are explored with different features and formats: (i) a collection of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images that exhibit three cancer-based pathologies; (ii) a tabular dataset containing patient demographic and healthcare-related information related to stroke pathology; (iii) ?.

Stroke is a huge problem to global health; it remains one of the most common causes of death and disability \cite{strokestudy}. The use of ML on stroke datasets is becoming a common practice because it makes it much easier for doctors to spot risks sooner and make better choices on the best treatment option for the patient \cite{heo_yoon_park_kim_nam_heo_2019}. The goal was to test different ML models to see which ones are best at classifying data and how unbalanced data impacts accurate predictions.

To approach the ML problems, an understanding of previous literature on the topic is required for an effective workflow. Academic papers were reviewed to gain an effective skill set and background knowledge required to begin experimentation.
